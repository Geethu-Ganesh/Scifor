# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING TKINTER
A Library Management System using Tkinter is a software project that provides a user-friendly graphical interface for efficiently managing library resources. This project is typically developed using the Python programming language and the Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface.
The project usually involves a technology stack that includes Python for the backend logic, Tkinter for the graphical user interface, and a database system (e.g., MySQL) to store and manage book information. The system aims to streamline library operations, making it easier to manage books, serve library users, and keep track of library resources.
